# Jump Up Super Star

This repository contains a 2D platformer game developed using Python and Pygame. The game features a character who navigates through a dynamically generated environment with obstacles and gaps. The objective is to avoid obstacles and not fall through gaps while the scenery scrolls horizontally.

## Features

- **Dynamic Floor Generation**: The game dynamically generates floor segments with gaps that act as challenges for the player.
- **Obstacle Management**: Includes randomly placed obstacles that the player must avoid to progress.
- **Seamless Background Scrolling**: A continuous scrolling background that enhances the visual experience.
- **Player Mechanics**: Includes basic movement such as running left/right and jumping. Additionally, the player is teleported back to the start if they fall through a gap.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language used for game logic.
- **Pygame**: Library used for game development.
